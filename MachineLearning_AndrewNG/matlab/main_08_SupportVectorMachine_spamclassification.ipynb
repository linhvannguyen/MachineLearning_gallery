    "Many email services today provide spam filters that are able to classify emails into spam and non-spam email with high accuracy. This note demonstrates the use of SVMs to build a spam filter. We will be training a classifier to classify whether a given email, x, is spam (y = 1) or non-spam (y = 0). To do so, we will need to convert each email into a feature vector $x \\in R^n$ for training a SVM classifier. \n",

    "The sample email contains a URL, an email address (at the end), numbers, and dollar amounts. While many emails would contain similar types of entities (e.g., numbers, other URLs, or other email addresses), the specific entities (e.g., the specific URL or specific dollar amount) will be different in almost every\n",
    "email. Therefore, one method often employed in processing emails is to \"normalize\" these values, so that all URLs are treated the same, all numbers are treated the same, etc. For example, we could replace each URL in the email with the unique string \"httpaddr\" to indicate that a URL was present. This has the effect of letting the spam classifier make a classification decision based on whether any URL was present, rather than whether a specific URL\n",
    "was present. This typically improves the performance of a spam classifier, since spammers often randomize the URLs, and thus the odds of seeing any particular URL again in a new piece of spam is very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "In processEmail.m, we have implemented the following email preprocessing and normalization steps:\n",
    "* **Lower-casing:** The entire email is converted into lower case, so that captialization is ignored (e.g., IndIcaTE is treated the same as Indicate).\n",
    "* **Stripping HTML:** All HTML tags are removed from the emails. Many emails often come with HTML formatting; we remove all the HTML tags, so that only the content remains.\n",
    "* **Normalizing URLs:** All URLs are replaced with the text *\"httpaddr\"*.\n",
    "* **Normalizing Email Addresses:** with the text *\"emailaddr\"*.\n",
    "* **Normalizing Numbers:** All email addresses are replaced All numbers are replaced with the text *\"number\"*.\n",
    "* **Normalizing Dollars:** All dollar signs ($) are replaced with the text *\"dollar\"*.\n",
    "* **Word Stemming:** Words are reduced to their stemmed form. For example, *\"discount\"*, *\"discounts\"*, *\"discounted\"* and *\"discounting\"* are all replaced with *\"discount\"*. Sometimes, the Stemmer actually strips off additional characters from the end, so *\"include\"*, *\"includes\"*, *\"included\"*, and *\"including\"* are all replaced with *\"includ\"*. \n",
    "* **Removal of non-words:** Non-words and punctuation have been removed. All white spaces (tabs, newlines, spaces) have all been trimmed to a single space character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of these preprocessing steps is shown in Figure 9. While pre-processing has left word fragments and non-words, this form turns out to be much easier to work with for performing feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vocabulary List:\n",
    "After preprocessing the emails, we have a list of words for each email. The next step is to choose which words we would like to use in our classifier and which we would want to leave out. For this test, we have chosen only the most frequently occuring words as our set of words considered (the vocabulary list). Since words that occur\n",
    "rarely in the training set are only in a few emails, they might cause the model to overfit our training set. The complete vocabulary list is in the file *vocab.txt*. This vocabulary list was selected by choosing all words which occur at least a 100 times in the spam corpus, resulting in a list of 1899 words. In practice, a vocabulary list with about 10,000 to 50,000 words is often used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the vocabulary list, we can now map each word in the preprocessed emails (e.g., Figure 9) into a list of word indices that contains the index of the word in the vocabulary list."
